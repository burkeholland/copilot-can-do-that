# Welcome to Constoso Music

This is Contoso Music, a simple music invetory app built using ExpressJS< Node, and SQLite with the Sequelize ORM. Our goal is to create a simple web API for the public that exposes the following data:

- Browse all artists, 50 to a page
- Browse all albums, 50 to a page
- Browse all playlists, 50 to a page
- Search for an album by name using a fuzzy search

The name of the project is `constoso-music` and it uses git for source control.
